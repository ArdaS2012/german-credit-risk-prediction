## üîß Configuration

### API Endpoint Configuration

By default, the app connects to `http://localhost:8000`. To change this:

1. Open `src/components/CreditRiskForm.js`
2. Find the API call in the `handleSubmit` function
3. Update the URL:
   ```javascript
   const response = await axios.post('YOUR_API_URL/predict', apiData, {
   ```

### Environment Variables (Production)

For production deployment, create a `.env` file:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
```

Then update the code to use:
```javascript
const apiUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with optimized production files.

### Deploy Options

#### 1. Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Deploy the build folder to your hosting service
```

#### 2. Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile` in the webapp directory:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t credit-risk-webapp .
docker run -p 3000:80 credit-risk-webapp
```

#### 3. Cloud Deployment

- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Static hosting with CDN
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Static website hosting
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Integrated CI/CD

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Error**:
   - Ensure the API server is running on `localhost:8000`
   - Check if Docker container is running: `docker ps`
   - Verify API health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

2. **CORS Issues**:
   - The API includes CORS headers for localhost:3000
   - For production, update CORS settings in the API

3. **Form Validation Errors**:
   - All fields are required
   - Check numeric field ranges (age, amounts, etc.)
   - Ensure dropdown selections are made

4. **Build Errors**:
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Node.js version (requires 14+)

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify API is responding: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Test API directly: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @sample_data.json`

## üéØ Example Usage Flow

1. **Start API**: `docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/ardas2012/german-credit-risk-prediction:main`
2. **Start Web App**: `npm start`
3. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Fill Form**: Complete all required fields
5. **Submit**: Click "Assess Credit Risk"
6. **View Results**: See risk assessment and confidence scores
7. **Reset**: Click "Assess Another Application" for new assessment
