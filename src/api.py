FastAPI application for German Credit Risk Prediction.

This module implements a production-ready REST API for credit risk prediction using
the trained machine learning models. It provides a complete web service with proper
validation, error handling, monitoring, and documentation.

Key Features:
- RESTful API endpoints for single and batch predictions
- Pydantic data validation with comprehensive input checking
- Prometheus metrics integration for production monitoring
- CORS support for web application integration
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI
- Health checks and system status monitoring
- Production-ready deployment configuration

API Endpoints:
- GET /health: System health check and status
- POST /predict: Single credit risk prediction
- POST /predict/batch: Batch predictions (up to 100 applications)
- GET /metrics: Prometheus monitoring metrics
- GET /model/info: Model information and performance
- GET /docs: Interactive API documentation
