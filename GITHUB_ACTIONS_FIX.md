# üîß GitHub Actions Docker Login Fix

## Issue
GitHub Actions workflow was failing with error:
```
Run docker/login-action@v3
Error: Username and password required
```

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Permissions**: The workflow didn't have explicit permissions to write to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
2. **Conflicting Workflows**: There were two workflows running simultaneously:
   - `ci-cd.yml` - Using GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) ‚úÖ
   - `ci-cd-dockerhub.yml` - Using Docker Hub (docker.io) ‚ùå (missing credentials)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Explicit Permissions
Updated `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to include:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write        # Required for GHCR push
  security-events: write # Required for Trivy scan uploads
```

### 2. Removed Conflicting Docker Hub Workflow
Deleted `.github/workflows/ci-cd-dockerhub.yml` because:
- It required Docker Hub credentials (`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`)
- GitHub Container Registry works without additional setup
- Having two workflows caused confusion and errors

### 3. Workflow Authentication
The remaining workflow uses:
- `username: ${{ github.actor }}` - GitHub username
- `password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` - Automatic GitHub token

### 4. Registry Configuration
```yaml
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
```

## Verification

After the fix:
1. ‚úÖ Workflow has proper permissions
2. ‚úÖ Only one workflow runs (GitHub Container Registry)
3. ‚úÖ Docker login should succeed
4. ‚úÖ Image builds and pushes to `ghcr.io/ardas2012/german-credit-risk-prediction`
5. ‚úÖ Security scans upload to GitHub Security tab

## Alternative Solutions

If issues persist, you can also:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token
1. Create PAT with `write:packages` scope
2. Add as repository secret `DOCKER_TOKEN`
3. Update workflow:
   ```yaml
   password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}
   ```

### Option 2: Repository Settings
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### Option 3: Use Docker Hub (if preferred)
1. Create Docker Hub account
2. Add repository secrets:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
3. Restore the Docker Hub workflow

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Fix committed and pushed
- ‚úÖ Conflicting workflow removed
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions will use updated permissions
- ‚úÖ Next push should build and deploy successfully
