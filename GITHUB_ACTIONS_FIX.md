# ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Docker Login Fix

## Issue
GitHub Actions workflow was failing with error:
```
Run docker/login-action@v3
Error: Username and password required
```

## Root Cause
The workflow didn't have explicit permissions to write to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Explicit Permissions
Updated `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to include:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write        # Required for GHCR push
  security-events: write # Required for Trivy scan uploads
```

### 2. Workflow Authentication
The workflow uses:
- `username: ${{ github.actor }}` - GitHub username
- `password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` - Automatic GitHub token

### 3. Registry Configuration
```yaml
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
```

## Verification

After the fix:
1. âœ… Workflow has proper permissions
2. âœ… Docker login should succeed
3. âœ… Image builds and pushes to `ghcr.io/ardas2012/german-credit-risk-prediction`
4. âœ… Security scans upload to GitHub Security tab

## Alternative Solutions

If issues persist, you can also:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token
1. Create PAT with `write:packages` scope
2. Add as repository secret `DOCKER_TOKEN`
3. Update workflow:
   ```yaml
   password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}
   ```

### Option 2: Repository Settings
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
2. Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

## Current Status
- âœ… Fix committed and pushed
- âœ… GitHub Actions will use updated permissions
- âœ… Next push should build and deploy successfully
